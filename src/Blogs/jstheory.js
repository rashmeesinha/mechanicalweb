      ques: "What is difference between var, let and const?",
      sol: `There are many differences: var and let are both used for variable declaration in javascript.
       var us function scoped and let is block scoped. variable declared with var is defined throughout 
       its defination function compared to let. let can be updated within its scope but can't be redeclared. 
       var & let declarations are hoisted to the top, but var is initialised as undefined, the let is not initialsed.
       const maintains a constant value. const is also not reinitialsed and hoisted.
      `
